Simply use an extension like tampermonkey or violentmonkey or whatever monkey you like and install whichever userscript you want :)

Firefox and Chrome with [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net) or [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/).

If you want, you can also check out my Greasyfork Profile, that's where I usually update my userscripts first:
